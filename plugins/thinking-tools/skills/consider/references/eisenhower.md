# Eisenhower Matrix: Urgency/Importance Prioritization

Categorize items by urgency and importance to clarify what to do, schedule, delegate, or eliminate.

## When to Use

- Overwhelmed by too many tasks
- Everything feels urgent
- Spending time on wrong things
- Need to separate busy work from meaningful work
- Reactive mode taking over proactive planning

## Execution Template

```markdown
**Context:** [what you're prioritizing - tasks, decisions, projects]

---

## Q1: DO FIRST (Important + Urgent)
*Crisis, deadlines, problems - handle immediately*

| Item | Action | Deadline |
|------|--------|----------|
| [Task] | [Specific next step] | [When] |

---

## Q2: SCHEDULE (Important + Not Urgent)
*Strategy, planning, development - protect this time*

| Item | When to Do | Why It Matters |
|------|------------|----------------|
| [Task] | [Scheduled time] | [Long-term impact] |

---

## Q3: DELEGATE (Not Important + Urgent)
*Interruptions, some meetings, some emails - minimize or hand off*

| Item | Delegate To / Minimize How |
|------|---------------------------|
| [Task] | [Who handles it / how to reduce time] |

---

## Q4: ELIMINATE (Not Important + Not Urgent)
*Time wasters, pleasant distractions - permission to drop*

| Item | Why It's Noise |
|------|----------------|
| [Task] | [Why this doesn't matter] |

---

**Immediate Focus:** [Single sentence: what to tackle RIGHT NOW]

**Q2 Protection:** [How to protect time for important-not-urgent work]
```

## Quality Checks

- Every item placed in exactly one quadrant
- "Important" = contributes to long-term goals/values (not just feels important)
- "Urgent" = has real deadline pressure (not manufactured urgency)
- Q2 items have scheduled time blocks (not just "later")
- Q4 items explicitly marked as droppable with permission

## Common Mistakes

- Treating everything as Q1 (urgency addiction)
- Neglecting Q2 (where real progress happens)
- Confusing "someone wants it" with "important"
- Not actually eliminating Q4 items

## Quadrant Insights

**Q1 (Do First)**: Necessary but should be minimized - too much Q1 means poor planning
**Q2 (Schedule)**: Where you should spend most time - prevention, planning, growth
**Q3 (Delegate)**: Others' priorities disguised as yours - learn to say no or delegate
**Q4 (Eliminate)**: Escape activities - be honest about what's actually waste

## Example

**Context:** Weekly work tasks

**Q1: DO FIRST**
| Item | Action | Deadline |
|------|--------|----------|
| Client bug report | Reproduce and fix | Today |
| Board presentation | Finish slides | Tomorrow |

**Q2: SCHEDULE**
| Item | When to Do | Why It Matters |
|------|------------|----------------|
| Architecture review | Thursday 2-4pm | Prevents future Q1 crises |
| Team 1:1s | Friday morning | Retention, growth |

**Q3: DELEGATE**
| Item | Delegate To / Minimize |
|------|------------------------|
| Status report formatting | Junior dev can template |
| Meeting scheduling | Use Calendly, stop email chains |

**Q4: ELIMINATE**
| Item | Why It's Noise |
|------|----------------|
| Slack channel debates | Entertainment, not productive |
| Perfectionist code polish | Good enough is good enough |

**Immediate Focus:** Fix client bug - it's blocking their launch
