# SWOT: Strategic Position Analysis

Map internal factors (Strengths/Weaknesses) and external factors (Opportunities/Threats) to inform strategy.

## When to Use

- Assessing competitive position
- Planning strategic initiatives
- Evaluating business opportunities
- Understanding where you stand before deciding where to go
- Need structured view of internal vs external factors

## The Framework

|          | Helpful | Harmful |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **Internal** | Strengths | Weaknesses |
| **External** | Opportunities | Threats |

**Internal** = things you control
**External** = things you don't control

## Execution Template

```markdown
**Subject:** [what's being analyzed - company, project, product, career]

---

## Strengths (Internal +)
*Advantages you have, resources you control*

| Strength | How to Leverage |
|----------|-----------------|
| [Strength 1] | [Action to maximize advantage] |
| [Strength 2] | [Action to maximize advantage] |
| [Strength 3] | [Action to maximize advantage] |

---

## Weaknesses (Internal -)
*Disadvantages, gaps, limitations you have*

| Weakness | How to Mitigate |
|----------|-----------------|
| [Weakness 1] | [Action to minimize impact] |
| [Weakness 2] | [Action to minimize impact] |
| [Weakness 3] | [Action to minimize impact] |

---

## Opportunities (External +)
*Favorable external conditions you could exploit*

| Opportunity | How to Capture |
|-------------|----------------|
| [Opportunity 1] | [Action to take advantage] |
| [Opportunity 2] | [Action to take advantage] |
| [Opportunity 3] | [Action to take advantage] |

---

## Threats (External -)
*Unfavorable external conditions that could harm you*

| Threat | How to Defend |
|--------|---------------|
| [Threat 1] | [Action to protect against] |
| [Threat 2] | [Action to protect against] |
| [Threat 3] | [Action to protect against] |

---

## Strategic Moves
*Combine quadrants into actionable strategies*

**SO Strategies** (Use Strengths to capture Opportunities)
- Use [strength] to pursue [opportunity]: [specific action]

**WO Strategies** (Address Weaknesses to enable Opportunities)
- Fix [weakness] to unlock [opportunity]: [specific action]

**ST Strategies** (Use Strengths to defend against Threats)
- Use [strength] to counter [threat]: [specific action]

**WT Strategies** (Minimize Weaknesses to avoid Threats)
- Reduce [weakness] exposure to [threat]: [specific action]

---

## Priority Actions

| Action | Type | Impact | Urgency |
|--------|------|--------|---------|
| [Top action] | [SO/WO/ST/WT] | [h/m/l] | [h/m/l] |
| [Second action] | [SO/WO/ST/WT] | [h/m/l] | [h/m/l] |
| [Third action] | [SO/WO/ST/WT] | [h/m/l] | [h/m/l] |
```

## Quality Checks

- Correctly categorized internal vs external
- Factors are specific and actionable (not generic)
- Each factor has a corresponding action
- Strategic moves connect multiple quadrants
- Balance between offense (SO) and defense (ST/WT)

## Common Mistakes

- Confusing internal weaknesses with external threats
- Being too vague ("good team" → what specifically?)
- Listing factors without strategic implications
- Only focusing on SO (ignoring defensive strategies)
- Treating SWOT as just a list, not strategic input

## Good Factor Tests

**Strengths**: "Would a competitor want this?"
**Weaknesses**: "Does this limit what we can do?"
**Opportunities**: "Is this external and favorable?"
**Threats**: "Is this external and could it hurt us?"

## Example

**Subject:** Small SaaS company considering enterprise market entry

**Strengths:**
| Strength | How to Leverage |
|----------|-----------------|
| Fast iteration speed | Ship enterprise features quickly |
| Strong NPS in SMB | Reference customers for enterprise prospects |
| Modern tech stack | SOC2 compliance easier than legacy vendors |

**Weaknesses:**
| Weakness | How to Mitigate |
|----------|-----------------|
| No enterprise sales team | Partner with VAR initially, hire later |
| Limited brand recognition | Focus on inbound from content, not cold outreach |
| Single-tenant architecture | Prioritize multi-tenant refactor before scale |

**Opportunities:**
| Opportunity | How to Capture |
|-------------|----------------|
| Legacy vendors have poor UX | Position as "modern alternative" |
| Remote work increasing demand | Target distributed-first companies |
| Competitor raised prices 40% | Reach their churning customers |

**Threats:**
| Threat | How to Defend |
|--------|---------------|
| Enterprise buyers want proven vendors | SOC2 + customer references + case studies |
| Long sales cycles drain runway | Keep SMB revenue growing while enterprise ramps |
| Big vendor could add our features | Move fast, own the niche |

**Strategic Moves:**
- **SO**: Use fast iteration + competitor price increase to win churning enterprise customers
- **WO**: Fix multi-tenant before scaling, use SMB references for enterprise credibility
- **ST**: Use modern UX as defense against "proven vendor" objection
- **WT**: Don't abandon SMB (cash flow) while building enterprise (protect runway threat)

**Priority Actions:**
1. Get SOC2 certified (enables enterprise) - ST - High/High
2. Build 3 enterprise case studies (credibility) - WO - High/Medium
3. Create competitor comparison pages (capture churn) - SO - Medium/High
