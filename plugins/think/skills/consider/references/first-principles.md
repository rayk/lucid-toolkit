# First Principles: Assumption Challenging

Strip away assumptions, conventions, and analogies to identify fundamental truths, then rebuild from scratch.

## When to Use

- Stuck doing things "the way they've always been done"
- Industry best practices feel wrong but you can't articulate why
- Need breakthrough innovation, not incremental improvement
- Reasoning by analogy ("X did it this way") feels limiting
- Want to question whether constraints are real

## Execution Template

```markdown
**Subject:** [the problem, belief, or approach being examined]

---

## Current Assumptions
*List everything taken for granted, even "obvious" things*

| Assumption | Challenge | Verdict |
|------------|-----------|---------|
| [What's assumed] | [Why might this be wrong?] | TRUE / FALSE / PARTIAL |
| [What's assumed] | [Why might this be wrong?] | TRUE / FALSE / PARTIAL |
| [What's assumed] | [Why might this be wrong?] | TRUE / FALSE / PARTIAL |

---

## Fundamental Truths
*What remains after stripping away assumptions - irreducible facts*

| Truth | Why Irreducible |
|-------|-----------------|
| [Base truth] | [Cannot be broken down further because...] |
| [Base truth] | [Cannot be broken down further because...] |

---

## Rebuilt Understanding
*Starting ONLY from fundamental truths, what can we conclude?*

[Reconstruction from first principles...]

---

## New Possibilities
*Without legacy assumptions, what options emerge?*

- [Option that wasn't visible before]
- [Option that wasn't visible before]

---

## Conventions Worth Keeping
*Some assumptions are valid - which ones and why?*

- [Convention]: Keep because [genuine reason, not just "everyone does it"]
```

## Quality Checks

- Assumptions include "obvious" things (those are often the real constraints)
- Challenges are genuine, not strawmen
- Fundamental truths are actually irreducible (physics, math, human nature)
- Rebuild doesn't smuggle assumptions back in
- Avoids reasoning by analogy ("Uber for X")

## Common Mistakes

- Only challenging surface assumptions (dig deeper)
- Treating conventions as truths without examination
- Rebuilding the same thing because it's familiar
- Confusing "hard to change" with "fundamental truth"

## Questions to Surface Assumptions

- "Why do we do it this way?"
- "What if the opposite were true?"
- "What would a newcomer find strange about this?"
- "What are we assuming about [users/technology/market]?"
- "What would we do if we started from scratch today?"

## Example

**Subject:** Enterprise software pricing model

**Current Assumptions:**
| Assumption | Challenge | Verdict |
|------------|-----------|---------|
| Must charge per seat | Open source competitors don't | FALSE |
| Enterprises want annual contracts | Many prefer flexibility | PARTIAL |
| Sales team required | PLG companies prove otherwise | FALSE |
| Higher price = perceived value | Can also signal inefficiency | PARTIAL |

**Fundamental Truths:**
| Truth | Why Irreducible |
|-------|-----------------|
| Value delivered must exceed price | Basic economics |
| Buyers have budget constraints | Organizational reality |
| Switching costs create stickiness | Human behavior |

**Rebuilt Understanding:**
If value > price is all that matters, and per-seat isn't fundamental, we could price on usage, outcomes, or value delivered rather than headcount.

**New Possibilities:**
- Usage-based pricing (pay for what you use)
- Outcome-based pricing (pay for results achieved)
- Freemium with enterprise features (prove value first)
