# Opportunity Cost: Tradeoff Analysis

Every yes is a no to something else. Analyze what you give up by choosing this option.

## When to Use

- Deciding how to allocate limited resources
- Something feels "affordable" but might be expensive
- Comparing options that use different resources
- Need to make tradeoffs explicit
- Evaluating investments (time, money, attention)

## The Core Insight

The true cost of anything is **what you give up to get it** - not the sticker price.

**Choice:** [what you're considering doing]

## Resources Required

| Resource | Amount | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Time | [hours/days/weeks] | [context] |
| Money | [amount] | [one-time vs recurring] |
| Energy/Attention | [high/medium/low] | [cognitive load, stress] |
| Opportunity | [what doors close] | [future options foreclosed] |
| Relationships | [social capital spent] | [who you're asking/imposing on] |

---

## Best Alternative Uses
*For EACH resource, what's the best OTHER thing you could do with it?*

| Resource | Best Alternative | Value of Alternative |
|----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| That time | [what else you'd do] | [outcome/value] |
| That money | [what else you'd buy/invest] | [outcome/value] |
| That energy | [what else you'd focus on] | [outcome/value] |

---

## True Cost Calculation

**Nominal cost:** [sticker price - time + money]

**Opportunity cost:** [value of best alternative foregone]

**True cost:** [nominal + opportunity cost]

---

## Value Comparison

| Option | What You Get | True Cost |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| Chosen option | [value/outcome] | [calculated above] |
| Best alternative | [value/outcome] | [its true cost] |

**Net value of choice:** [Value of chosen] - [Value of alternative]

---

## Verdict

**Is the chosen option worth more than the best alternative?**

[YES/NO] because: [reasoning]

## Quality Checks

- Compared to BEST alternative, not just any alternative
- All resource types considered (not just money)
- Alternative values are realistic, not hypothetical maximums
- Accounts for optionality (doors that close)
- Makes hidden costs explicit

## Common Mistakes

- Only counting money (time and attention are often more scarce)
- Comparing to average alternative instead of best
- Ignoring sunk costs fallacy (past spending is irrelevant)
- Forgetting that "doing nothing" is also a choice with costs

## Types of Opportunity Costs

**Direct**: Money spent here can't be spent there
**Temporal**: Time spent here can't be spent there
**Attention**: Focus here means neglect elsewhere
**Optionality**: This choice forecloses future choices
**Social**: Favors asked deplete relationship capital

## Example

**Choice:** Attend 3-day industry conference ($2,000 + travel)

**Resources Required:**
| Resource | Amount | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Time | 3 days + travel | Plus recovery day |
| Money | $3,500 | Registration, flights, hotel, meals |
| Energy | High | Socializing is draining |
| Opportunity | Miss client deadline | Have to push back delivery |

**Best Alternative Uses:**
| Resource | Best Alternative | Value of Alternative |
|----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| 3 days | Deep work on product launch | Could ship 2 weeks earlier |
| $3,500 | Hire contractor for backlog | Clear 40 hours of tasks |
| Energy | Focused client work | Strengthen key relationship |

**True Cost Calculation:**
- Nominal: $3,500 + 3 days
- Opportunity: 2-week delay on launch + 40 hours of cleared backlog
- True cost: $3,500 + product delay + contractor value

**Verdict:**
**NO** - The conference networking is speculative value while the alternatives are concrete. Would need specific meetings scheduled to justify.

**Hidden costs revealed:** The real cost isn't $3,500 - it's the product launch delay, which affects revenue timeline.
