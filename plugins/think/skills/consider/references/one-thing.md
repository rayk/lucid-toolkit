# One Thing: Leverage Identification

Identify the single highest-leverage action - the domino that knocks down all others.

## When to Use

- Overwhelmed by too many priorities
- Need to cut through noise to find leverage
- Everything feels equally important
- Want to simplify decision-making
- Looking for force multipliers

## The Core Question

> "What's the ONE thing I can do such that by doing it everything else will be easier or unnecessary?"

## Execution Template

```markdown
**Goal:** [ultimate outcome you're trying to achieve]

---

## Candidate Actions
*List all possible actions that could contribute*

| Action | Downstream Effects | Makes Other Things... |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| [Action 1] | [What it enables] | Easier / Unnecessary / Neither |
| [Action 2] | [What it enables] | Easier / Unnecessary / Neither |
| [Action 3] | [What it enables] | Easier / Unnecessary / Neither |
| [Action 4] | [What it enables] | Easier / Unnecessary / Neither |

---

## The One Thing

**Selected:** [The action that enables or eliminates the most other actions]

**Why This One:**
- It makes [X, Y, Z] easier because: [causal chain]
- It makes [A, B] unnecessary because: [causal chain]
- Without it, [other actions] can't succeed because: [dependency]

---

## The Domino Effect
*Trace the cascade*

```
[One Thing]
    ↓ enables
[Second domino]
    ↓ enables
[Third domino]
    ↓ enables
[Goal achieved]
```

---

## Next Action

**Specific step:** [Concrete, immediately actionable first step]
**When:** [Now / Today / This week]
**Success looks like:** [How you'll know it's done]

---

## What to Ignore (For Now)
*These can wait until the One Thing is done*

- [Deprioritized item] - revisit after [milestone]
- [Deprioritized item] - revisit after [milestone]
```

## Quality Checks

- Selected action is genuinely leveraged (not just important)
- Causal chain is clear and logical
- Other actions actually depend on this one
- Next action is specific enough to do RIGHT NOW
- "Everything else can wait" feels true

## Common Mistakes

- Picking the most urgent thing (urgency ≠ leverage)
- Picking what you're most comfortable with
- Multiple "one things" (that's not how this works)
- Vague one thing ("work harder") vs specific ("ship the landing page")

## Finding Leverage

Ask these questions:
- "What's blocking everything else?"
- "What would create a cascade of progress?"
- "What's the constraint in the system?"
- "If I could only do ONE thing this week, what would matter most?"
- "What am I avoiding that would unlock the most?"

## Example

**Goal:** Launch consulting business and get first 3 paying clients

**Candidate Actions:**
| Action | Downstream Effects | Makes Other Things... |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Build website | Professional presence | Neither (doesn't get clients) |
| Write thought leadership | Builds credibility | Easier (attracts inbound) |
| Cold outreach to 50 prospects | Direct path to clients | Unnecessary (if it works) |
| Define service offering | Clarity for sales | Easier (enables everything) |
| Network at events | Relationship building | Neither (slow, indirect) |

**The One Thing:**
**Selected:** Define service offering

**Why This One:**
- Makes cold outreach easier because: know exactly what to pitch
- Makes website easier because: know what to say
- Makes pricing easier because: know what you're selling
- Without it: every other action is unfocused

**The Domino Effect:**
```
Define clear offering
    ↓ enables
Confident outreach with specific pitch
    ↓ enables
Conversations convert at higher rate
    ↓ enables
First 3 clients acquired
```

**Next Action:**
**Specific step:** Write one paragraph describing the exact problem I solve and for whom
**When:** Today, next 30 minutes
**Success looks like:** Can explain offering in <60 seconds
