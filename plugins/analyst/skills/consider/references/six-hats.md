# Six Thinking Hats: Parallel Perspective Exploration

Structured parallel thinking through six distinct modes. Everyone wears the same hat at the same time - no mode is better than another.

## When to Use

- Group decisions needing multiple perspectives
- Emotions and logic need explicit separation
- Exploring ideas from all angles before committing
- Meetings that get stuck in argument loops
- Decisions where gut feelings conflict with data

## The Framework

| Hat | Mode | Focus | Key Questions |
|-----|------|-------|---------------|
| White | Facts | Neutral, objective data | "What do we know? What's missing?" |
| Red | Feelings | Gut reactions, intuition | "How do I feel about this?" |
| Black | Caution | Risks, flaws, dangers | "What could go wrong?" |
| Yellow | Optimism | Benefits, best-case | "What's the upside?" |
| Green | Creativity | Alternatives, new ideas | "What else could we try?" |
| Blue | Process | Facilitation, summary | "What's our goal? What's next?" |

**Critical Rule**: Yellow before Black (see value before criticizing)

## Sequence Recipes

Choose based on your goal:

| Goal | Sequence |
|------|----------|
| Initial Idea Generation | Blue → White → Green → Blue |
| Problem Solving | Blue → White → Green → Red → Yellow → Black → Green → Blue |
| Strategic Planning | Blue → Yellow → Black → White → Blue → Green → Blue |
| Quick Feedback | Blue → Black → Green → Blue |
| Full Exploration | Blue → White → Red → Yellow → Black → Green → Blue |

## Execution Template

```markdown
**Decision/Problem:** [what we're analyzing]

---

## Blue Hat (Opening)
**Goal:** [clear statement of what we're deciding]
**Sequence:** [chosen sequence and why]

---

## White Hat (Facts)
*Neutral, objective - data only*

**Known Facts:**
- [fact 1 - with source if available]
- [fact 2]
- [fact 3]

**Information Gaps:**
- [what we don't know but need]
- [data that would help]

---

## Red Hat (Feelings)
*30 seconds each - NO justification allowed*

- [gut reaction 1]
- [gut reaction 2]
- [gut reaction 3]

---

## Yellow Hat (Benefits)
*Positive value - even in flawed ideas*

| Benefit | Who Gains |
|---------|-----------|
| [upside 1] | [beneficiary] |
| [upside 2] | [beneficiary] |
| [upside 3] | [beneficiary] |

---

## Black Hat (Risks)
*Critical judgment - specific concerns*

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| [flaw/danger 1] | [h/m/l] | [how to address] |
| [flaw/danger 2] | [h/m/l] | [how to address] |
| [flaw/danger 3] | [h/m/l] | [how to address] |

---

## Green Hat (Alternatives)
*Creative - "what if" thinking*

| Alternative | What's Different |
|-------------|------------------|
| [new idea 1] | [novelty] |
| [new idea 2] | [novelty] |
| [modification to original] | [improvement] |

## Blue Hat (Closing)

**Summary:** [key insight from each hat]

**Decision/Recommendation:** [direction based on full analysis]

**Next Steps:**
1. [action item - often White Hat research needs]
2. [action item]
3. [action item]
```

## Quality Checks

- Each hat stays strictly within its mode
- Red Hat contains feelings only (no explanations)
- Yellow comes before Black (value before criticism)
- Black Hat critiques are specific, not vague fears
- Green Hat generates genuinely novel alternatives
- Blue Hat provides clear process guidance

## Common Mistakes

- **Skipping Red Hat**: Unexpressed emotions leak into "objective" thinking
- **Black Hat too early**: Kills creative exploration before ideas develop
- **Mixing modes**: Arguing facts while supposedly doing feelings
- **Vague Green Hat**: Variations instead of genuinely new alternatives
- **No Blue Hat summary**: Session ends without clear next steps

## Pro Tips

- **Physical props help**: Colored cards reinforce mode-switching
- **Timebox strictly**: Red Hat max 30 seconds per person
- **Facilitator stays Blue**: One person manages process, doesn't contribute ideas
- **Capture everything**: Even "bad" Red Hat feelings reveal important signals

## Example

**Decision:** Should we adopt a 4-day work week?

**Blue Hat (Opening)**
Goal: Decide whether to pilot 4-day week for Q2
Sequence: Full exploration - significant policy change

**White Hat**
- Productivity drops 15% on Fridays (internal metrics)
- 3 competitors have adopted 4-day weeks
- 40% of staff live >1 hour away
- Gap: Need competitor outcome data

**Red Hat**
- Excited about work-life balance
- Anxious about compressed deadlines
- Skeptical this reduces hours vs compresses them

**Yellow Hat**
| Benefit | Who Gains |
|---------|-----------|
| Reduced burnout | Team retention |
| Recruiting advantage | Talent acquisition |
| Forced prioritization | Productivity |

**Black Hat**
| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Client coverage gaps | High | Rotating Friday coverage |
| Compressed stress | Medium | Scope reduction, not compression |
| Cross-team sync issues | Medium | Align off-days |

**Green Hat**
| Alternative | What's Different |
|-------------|------------------|
| 4.5-day week (Friday PM off) | Lower risk trial |
| Summer Fridays only | Time-bounded experiment |
| Results-only environment | Focus on output not hours |

**Blue Hat (Closing)**
Summary: Strong emotional support, valid productivity concerns, multiple creative alternatives emerged.
Decision: Pilot "Summer Fridays" for Q2 - lower risk, generates data
Next Steps: 1) Survey clients on Friday needs, 2) Define success metrics, 3) Create coverage rotation
