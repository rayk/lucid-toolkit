# 10-10-10: Time Horizon Analysis

Evaluate decisions across three time horizons to overcome present bias and emotional hijacking.

## When to Use

- Emotions are running high (fear, excitement, anxiety)
- Short-term and long-term interests seem to conflict
- You suspect you're being impulsive
- Decision has lasting consequences
- Need to distinguish temporary discomfort from lasting regret

## Execution Template

```markdown
**Decision:** [what you're choosing between - state options clearly]

---

**Option A: [Name]**

| Horizon | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| 10 Minutes | [Immediate emotional reaction and practical consequence] |
| 10 Months | [Medium-term reality - what life looks like] |
| 10 Years | [Long-term impact on trajectory, identity, relationships] |

**Option B: [Name]**

| Horizon | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| 10 Minutes | [Immediate emotional reaction and practical consequence] |
| 10 Months | [Medium-term reality - what life looks like] |
| 10 Years | [Long-term impact on trajectory, identity, relationships] |

---

**Time Conflicts Identified:**
[Where short-term pain leads to long-term gain, or short-term pleasure leads to long-term regret]

**Present Bias Check:**
[Is the 10-minute feeling disproportionately influencing the decision?]

**Recommendation:**
[Which option, weighted toward longer time horizons, with reasoning]
```

## Quality Checks

- 10-year view is genuinely imagined, not hand-waved
- Short-term discomfort isn't overweighted
- Accounts for adaptation (we adjust to new normals)
- Considers regret in both directions (action AND inaction)
- Makes long-term consequences visceral and real

## Common Mistakes

- Treating all three horizons as equally weighted (long-term should dominate)
- Imagining 10-year impact too abstractly
- Ignoring that short-term pain often fades quickly
- Not considering the "and then what" after 10 minutes

## Example

**Decision:** Accept job offer with 40% pay increase but longer commute vs stay at current role

**Option A: Take New Job**
| Horizon | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| 10 Minutes | Excitement, anxiety about change, fear of unknown |
| 10 Months | Adjusted to commute, higher savings rate, new skills learned |
| 10 Years | Significantly better financial position, career advancement, but time cost with family |

**Option B: Stay**
| Horizon | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| 10 Minutes | Relief, comfort, slight disappointment |
| 10 Months | Same routine, wondering "what if", stable but stagnant |
| 10 Years | May regret not taking risk, missed compound growth |

**Time Conflicts:** Short-term comfort of staying vs long-term growth of leaving

**Recommendation:** Take new job - the 10-minute anxiety will fade, but the 10-year financial and career impact compounds
