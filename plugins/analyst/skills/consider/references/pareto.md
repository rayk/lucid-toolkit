# Pareto (80/20): Impact Prioritization

Identify the vital few factors (~20%) that drive the majority of results (~80%).

## When to Use

- Too many things competing for attention
- Need to focus limited resources
- Want maximum results with minimum effort
- Analyzing what actually drives outcomes
- Cutting through noise to find signal

## The Principle

In most systems, a small number of inputs create most of the outputs:
- 20% of customers generate 80% of revenue
- 20% of bugs cause 80% of crashes
- 20% of features get 80% of usage

## Execution Template

```markdown
**Domain:** [what you're analyzing - tasks, customers, features, etc.]

**Desired Outcome:** [what result you're optimizing for]

## Factor Analysis

| Factor | Estimated Impact | Evidence |
|--------|-----------------|----------|
| [Factor 1] | [high/medium/low or %] | [data or reasoning] |
| [Factor 2] | [high/medium/low or %] | [data or reasoning] |
| [Factor 3] | [high/medium/low or %] | [data or reasoning] |
| [Factor 4] | [high/medium/low or %] | [data or reasoning] |
| [Factor 5] | [high/medium/low or %] | [data or reasoning] |

## Vital Few (Focus Here)
*The ~20% that drives ~80% of results*

| Factor | Why Vital | Specific Action |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| [Top factor] | [Impact mechanism] | [What to do] |
| [Second factor] | [Impact mechanism] | [What to do] |
| [Third factor] | [Impact mechanism] | [What to do] |

---

## Trivial Many (Deprioritize)
*The ~80% that drives only ~20% of results*

| Factor | Why Trivial | Disposition |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| [Factor] | [Low impact because...] | Defer / Delegate / Drop |
| [Factor] | [Low impact because...] | Defer / Delegate / Drop |

---

## Resource Reallocation

**Current allocation:** [where time/money/attention goes now]

**Optimal allocation:** [where it should go based on 80/20]

**Shift required:** [what to do more of, what to do less of]

---

## Bottom Line

**Focus on:** [single sentence on where to concentrate effort]

**Ignore:** [what to deliberately deprioritize]
```

## Quality Checks

- Factors are specific, not vague categories
- Impact estimates are based on evidence or reasoned analysis
- "Vital few" actually are few (not half the list)
- Actions for vital few are specific and actionable
- Permission explicitly granted to ignore trivial many

## Common Mistakes

- Treating all factors as equally important
- Not actually deprioritizing the trivial many
- Using 80/20 as exact numbers (it's a pattern, not a rule)
- Analyzing factors without changing behavior

## Finding the 20%

Questions to identify vital few:
- "If I could only do ONE of these, which would matter most?"
- "What's actually correlated with the outcome I want?"
- "What do top performers do that others don't?"
- "Where have small efforts produced outsized results?"
- "What would I protect if I had to cut 80%?"

## Example

**Domain:** Customer success activities
**Desired Outcome:** Reduce churn rate

**Factor Analysis:**
| Factor | Estimated Impact | Evidence |
|--------|-----------------|----------|
| Onboarding call quality | High (40%) | Churned users 3x more likely to skip onboarding |
| Monthly check-ins | Medium (15%) | Some correlation with retention |
| Feature education emails | Low (5%) | Low open rates, no retention correlation |
| Quarterly business reviews | Medium (20%) | Enterprise customers who do QBRs stay 2x longer |
| Support ticket response time | High (20%) | NPS drops 40 points when >24hr response |

**Vital Few:**
| Factor | Why Vital | Specific Action |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| Onboarding calls | 40% of churn prevented by good onboarding | Script calls, track completion, follow up on no-shows |
| QBRs for enterprise | 20% impact on highest-value segment | Mandate QBRs in enterprise contracts |
| Support response | 20% impact across all customers | Hire to maintain <4hr response SLA |

**Trivial Many:**
| Factor | Why Trivial | Disposition |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Feature education emails | 5% impact, low engagement | Automate and forget |
| Monthly check-ins | 15% but time-intensive | Automate for SMB, keep for enterprise |

**Bottom Line:**
**Focus on:** Onboarding excellence and support speed
**Ignore:** Email campaigns and routine check-ins for smaller accounts
