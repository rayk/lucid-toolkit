# Via Negativa: Improvement by Subtraction

Instead of asking "What should I add?", ask "What should I remove?" Subtraction often beats addition.

## When to Use

- System feels bloated or overcomplicated
- Adding more isn't helping
- Need to simplify without breaking things
- "Less is more" might apply
- Maintenance burden is growing
- Decision fatigue from too many options

## The Principle

Often the best way to improve is to **remove** rather than add:
- Remove bad habits rather than add good ones
- Remove distractions rather than add productivity tools
- Remove features rather than add complexity
- Remove commitments rather than add time management

## Execution Template

```markdown
**Subject:** [what you're simplifying - project, process, product, life area]

**Current State:** [description of what exists now]

---

## Inventory
*List everything currently present*

| Item | Category | Added When | Why It Exists |
|------|----------|------------|---------------|
| [Item 1] | [feature/process/commitment/etc] | [date/era] | [original reason] |
| [Item 2] | [feature/process/commitment/etc] | [date/era] | [original reason] |
| [Item 3] | [feature/process/commitment/etc] | [date/era] | [original reason] |

---

## Subtraction Analysis
*For each item: "Does removing this improve the outcome?"*

| Item | Remove? | Reason | Impact of Removal |
|------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| [Item] | YES | [why it's not adding value] | [what improves] |
| [Item] | YES | [why it's not adding value] | [what improves] |
| [Item] | NO | [genuine value it provides] | N/A - keep |
| [Item] | MAYBE | [unclear value] | [test by removing] |

---

## Removal Plan

**Definitely Remove:**
| Item | Action | When |
|------|--------|------|
| [Item] | [how to remove] | [timeline] |

**Test Removal (Reversible):**
| Item | Test Method | Success Criteria |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| [Item] | [how to test without it] | [how to know if it's missed] |

---

## After Subtraction

**State After Removal:**
[Description of leaner, simpler state]

**What Improves:**
- [Improvement 1]
- [Improvement 2]

**Maintenance Reduced:**
[What you no longer need to maintain/manage/think about]

---

## Future Additions Filter
*What to say NO to going forward*

Before adding anything, ask:
- Does this solve a problem we actually have?
- Can we achieve the same by removing something instead?
- What's the maintenance cost?
- Does this complicate the system?

**Pre-committed NO to:**
- [Type of thing to reject]
- [Type of thing to reject]
```

## Quality Checks

- Inventory is complete (include hidden/assumed things)
- Removal decisions are based on actual value, not familiarity
- "Keep" items have genuine, articulated value
- Removal doesn't break core function
- Future filter prevents re-accumulation

## Common Mistakes

- Keeping things because they're familiar
- Not testing removals (some things aren't missed)
- Removing symptoms but not causes
- Adding complexity to manage complexity
- Hoarding "just in case"

## Subtraction Questions

- "What would we NOT do if starting fresh today?"
- "What exists only because we've always done it?"
- "What would we not miss if it disappeared?"
- "What requires maintenance but rarely provides value?"
- "What could we stop doing with no negative consequence?"

## Domains for Via Negativa

**Code**: Remove dead code, unused features, premature abstractions
**Process**: Remove meetings, approvals, handoffs that don't add value
**Product**: Remove features users don't use
**Personal**: Remove commitments, possessions, habits that drain energy
**Communication**: Remove unnecessary emails, messages, updates

## Example

**Subject:** Weekly team processes
**Current State:** 5 recurring meetings, 3 status reports, 2 tools for project tracking

**Inventory:**
| Item | Category | Added When | Why It Exists |
|------|----------|------------|---------------|
| Monday standup | Meeting | 2 years ago | Sync on week priorities |
| Wednesday check-in | Meeting | 1 year ago | Mid-week status |
| Friday retro | Meeting | 2 years ago | Continuous improvement |
| Daily async update in Slack | Report | 6 months ago | Visibility |
| JIRA board | Tool | 3 years ago | Ticket tracking |
| Notion project docs | Tool | 1 year ago | Documentation |
| Weekly status email | Report | 2 years ago | Leadership visibility |

**Subtraction Analysis:**
| Item | Remove? | Reason | Impact of Removal |
|------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Wednesday check-in | YES | Duplicates Monday standup + Slack | +1 hour/week for team |
| Daily async update | YES | Creates busywork, rarely read | +30min/day of focus time |
| Weekly status email | YES | Leadership can check Notion | -1 hour prep time |
| Friday retro | MAYBE | Valuable but exhausting weekly | Try biweekly |
| JIRA board | NO | Essential for sprint tracking | N/A |
| Monday standup | NO | Sets weekly direction | N/A |
| Notion docs | NO | Single source of truth | N/A |

**After Subtraction:**
- 3 meetings → 2 meetings (Monday standup + biweekly retro)
- 3 reports → 0 reports (use Notion for async visibility)
- 2 tools → 2 tools (both essential)

**What Improves:**
- ~4 hours/week recovered per person
- Reduced context switching
- Less "performative work"
- More deep focus time

**Pre-committed NO to:**
- New recurring meetings (require 1-month trial)
- New status reports (use existing tools)
- New tools unless replacing existing one
