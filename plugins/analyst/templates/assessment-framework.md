## Situation Assessment

**Subject**: [What are you assessing?]
**Date**: [Current date]
**Context**: [Brief background - 1-2 sentences]

### Classification

- **Problem Type**: [ ] Diagnosis [ ] Decision [ ] Prioritization [ ] Risk [ ] Strategy
- **Temporal Focus**: [ ] Past [ ] Present [ ] Future
- **Complexity**: [ ] Simple [ ] Complicated [ ] Complex
- **Information State**: [ ] Sufficient [ ] Sparse [ ] Conflicting

### Key Questions

1. What is the core issue or decision?
2. What constraints exist?
3. What does success look like?
4. What are the risks of inaction?

### Analysis

[Apply selected mental model(s) here]

### Synthesis

**Key Insight**: [Single most important finding]
**Recommended Action**: [Specific next step]
**Confidence**: [ ] High [ ] Medium [ ] Low
**Reasoning**: [Why this confidence level?]

### Open Questions

- [What couldn't be determined?]
- [What needs more information?]
```

## Assessment Types

### Situation Assessment
Use when: You need to understand current state before acting

Focus on:
- What is actually happening vs. what you assume
- Key stakeholders and their perspectives
- Constraints and resources available
- Urgency and importance

### Decision Assessment
Use when: Choosing between discrete options

Focus on:
- Clear articulation of options
- Criteria for evaluation
- Tradeoffs between options
- Reversibility of decision

### Risk Assessment
Use when: Evaluating potential negative outcomes

Focus on:
- What could go wrong (Inversion)
- Likelihood vs. impact
- Mitigation strategies
- Acceptable risk threshold

### Strategic Assessment
Use when: Evaluating position and direction

Focus on:
- Current position (SWOT)
- Competitive landscape
- Long-term consequences (Second-Order)
- Resource allocation

## Assessment Quality Checklist

Before finalizing an assessment, verify:

- [ ] Problem correctly classified
- [ ] Appropriate model(s) selected for problem type
- [ ] Key assumptions explicitly stated
- [ ] Evidence cited for major claims
- [ ] Confidence level justified
- [ ] Action is specific and achievable
- [ ] Risks of recommendation acknowledged

## Common Assessment Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Symptom | Remedy |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Confirmation bias | Only evidence supporting preferred option | Apply Inversion |
| Analysis paralysis | Can't decide due to information overload | Use Pareto + One Thing |
| Recency bias | Overweighting recent events | Use 10-10-10 for time perspective |
| Sunk cost fallacy | "We've invested too much to stop" | Use Opportunity Cost |
| Anchoring | Fixating on first information | Use First Principles |

## Output Formats

### Brief (1 paragraph)
For simple decisions or quick checks. State situation, key insight, and recommendation.

### Standard (this template)
For most assessments. Full structured analysis with clear recommendation.

### Comprehensive
For major decisions. Include multiple model applications, stakeholder analysis, implementation plan, and risk mitigation.
