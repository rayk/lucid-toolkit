# Mental Models Quick Reference

A concise reference for selecting and applying mental models in the think plugin.

## Model Selection Guide

| Situation | Primary Model | When to Use |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| "Why did this happen?" | 5-Whys | Root cause diagnosis |
| "Should I do X or Y?" | 10-10-10 | Decision with emotional weight |
| "What should I do first?" | Eisenhower | Task prioritization |
| "What am I assuming?" | First Principles | Challenge assumptions |
| "What could go wrong?" | Inversion | Risk assessment |
| "Which explanation is right?" | Occam's Razor | Competing hypotheses |
| "What's the highest leverage?" | One Thing | Focus on impact |
| "What am I giving up?" | Opportunity Cost | Tradeoff analysis |
| "What matters most?" | Pareto (80/20) | Impact prioritization |
| "What happens next?" | Second-Order | Consequence chains |
| "Where do we stand?" | SWOT | Strategic position |
| "What should I remove?" | Via Negativa | Simplification |
| "What are all the angles?" | Six Hats | Parallel perspectives |

## Model Summaries

### 5-Whys
Ask "why" five times to drill to root cause. Stop when you reach something actionable.

### 10-10-10
Evaluate decisions across time horizons: How will I feel in 10 minutes? 10 months? 10 years?

### Eisenhower Matrix
Categorize tasks by urgency (time-sensitive) and importance (meaningful impact):
- Urgent + Important → Do now
- Important, not Urgent → Schedule
- Urgent, not Important → Delegate
- Neither → Eliminate

### First Principles
Break down to fundamental truths, then rebuild. Ask: "What do I know to be absolutely true?"

### Inversion
Flip the problem: "How would I guarantee failure?" Then avoid those things.

### Occam's Razor
Prefer the simplest explanation with fewest assumptions.

### One Thing
"What's the ONE thing I can do such that by doing it everything else becomes easier or unnecessary?"

### Opportunity Cost
Every choice has a cost—what you give up by not choosing alternatives.

### Pareto (80/20)
Roughly 80% of effects come from 20% of causes. Find and focus on the vital few.

### Second-Order Thinking
Ask "And then what?" repeatedly. First-order: immediate. Second-order: consequences of consequences.

### SWOT Analysis
Map Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats in a 2x2 matrix (internal/external × positive/negative).

### Via Negativa
Improve by removing negatives rather than adding positives. What should you stop doing?

### Six Thinking Hats
Explore from six perspectives: White (facts), Red (feelings), Black (risks), Yellow (benefits), Green (alternatives), Blue (process). Everyone wears the same hat at the same time.

## Combining Models

**For root cause analysis**: 5-Whys → First Principles → Inversion

**For major decisions**: Opportunity Cost → Second-Order → 10-10-10

**For prioritization**: Pareto → One Thing → Via Negativa

**For strategy**: SWOT → Inversion → Second-Order

**For group deliberation**: Six Hats → Second-Order → Opportunity Cost
